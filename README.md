Our main objective is to transfer and store data of any type wirelessly which can be accessed at any point of time and place.  
This is been present in Mac over a generation and No one started an initiative.
We are using SOCKETS in python to make this data transfer more efficient.
The Security features are : 1.All data are Encrypted.
                            2.Only authorized users can access data from the server.
This app will help to transfer of data from one machine to another efficiently.                            

# WORKING
we used scoket in python to send and recive data in bytes
we designed a ## SYNTAX for our server 
Client can request the server using the syntax (Server can only understand ProperSyntax)

# DataStorage
data is stored in .txt in server
but clint can get file in the desire formate

# SCREEN SHOTS
We devolped a GUI for client
this the clint window

// TI can only preview it
